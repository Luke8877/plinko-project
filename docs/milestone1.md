# Project Development Milestone 1 â€“ Plinko  
**Course:** CPRO 2501  
**Student:** Luke Thompson  

---

## Technical Progress  
- **Setup done:** A React + Vite environment was created and runs locally.  
- **GitHub done:** Repository initialized, branches created and merged, and project pushed to GitHub.  
- **Basic CRUD/Data Storage started:** A mock data file (`mockData.js`) was created with sample users and balances. This demonstrates initial data storage functionality.  
- **User interface drafted:** An authentication placeholder component (`LoginPlaceholder.jsx`) was added to the UI. This represents the registration and login system that will be implemented.

## Features  

### Authentication (User Registration/Login)  
- Placeholder React component created and rendered in the UI.  
- Schema for `Users` table already drafted in the project proposal.  
- Future steps: add form inputs, password hashing, and database integration.  

### Plinko Game Loop  
- Game loop and randomization logic designed in the proposal.  
- A `GamePlaceholder` React component was added to represent where the Plinko board and random outcomes will be displayed.  
- This demonstrates progress and sets up the UI for further development.    
- Future steps: connect randomization to balance tracking and reports/statistics.  

### Balance Tracking  
- Database schema drafted for storing credits/tokens.  
- Placeholder values included in mock data (`balance: 100`).  
- Future steps: implement real updates when bets/wins occur.  

### Reporting/Statistics  
- Reports Table drafted in database schema (win/loss ratio, biggest win).  
- Implementation planned for later milestones.  

### Save/Load System  
- Schema for saving users and game sessions designed in proposal.  
- Implementation pending.
