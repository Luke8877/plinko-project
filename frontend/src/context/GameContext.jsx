/**
 * GameContext
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Placeholder for centralizing gameplay UI state such as:
 * • Active bets
 * • Selected game mode
 * • Round progress + animations
 *
 * MVP implementation keeps state localized to GamePage and
 * components for simplicity and clarity. Maintaining this file
 * ensures easy expansion into richer, multi-component game logic
 * without requiring a structural refactor later.
