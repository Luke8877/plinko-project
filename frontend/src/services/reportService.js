/**
 * Report Service
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Responsible for analytics + historical data requests.
 *
 * Current Status:
 *   - Dashboard `getReport()` is mapped to authService currently
 *   - No dedicated reporting endpoints active at this time
 *
 * Future Expansion Ideas:
 *   - Lifetime wins / losses
 *   - Hit frequency per multiplier slot
 *   - Leaderboard lookup or trend processing
 *
 * This placeholder maintains clean separation of concerns
 * as reporting grows beyond MVP scope.
